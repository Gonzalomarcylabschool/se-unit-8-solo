### Key Terms

- state
- props
- hooks
- useState()

### Essential Questions

- What is state and what are props (properties)?
- How do state and props differ?
- What are React hooks?
- How do we use the `useState()` hook?
- What are the rules and restrictions of use state?


### Learning Assignments:
- **Tutorial**: Scrimba ["Build a AirBnB Experiences clone" Section](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) (2 hours)

- Learn about the React hook called `useState()`. Follow along with this [popular tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xhKH43llhU), which is about 15 minutes long.

- Here are descriptions about the differences between [state and props](https://github.com/uberVU/react-guide/blob/master/props-vs-state.md).

+ **Documentation**: Review Official React Docs
  + [React documentation on useState()](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)
  + [Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)
  + [Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)
  + [Lists and Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

### Practice

- `cd practice/counter-app`
- `npm install`
- open two terminals
- in the first terminal, run `npm start`
- view the app in `localhost:3000` (this should open automatically with `npm start`)
- in the second terminal, run `npm test`. Tests will run automatically when you update the <App/> component. But you can also ENTER `a` in order to manually re-run tests.
- Follow the tests in `practice/counter-app/App.tests.js` in order to create a counter application.
